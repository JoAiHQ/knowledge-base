# AGENT GUIDELINES

- Punctuation: Use en dashes (–) instead of em dashes (—) and put a space before them and after them.
- Tone: Avoid commanding language like "You must". Use softer alternatives like "You can" or "It is required".

## GERMAN LOCALIZATION (DE)
- Strict Informal: Always use "Du" (never "Sie"). Keep sentences short and meaningful. Use impersonal phrasing where possible.
